## Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ng221404-bot/Telebot-verification-.git
cd Telebot-verification-
```

### 2. Create a Telegram Bot

1.  Talk to the BotFather on Telegram (`@BotFather`).
2.  Use the `/newbot` command to create a new bot.
3.  Follow the instructions to set up a name and username for your bot.
4.  BotFather will give you an **API Token**. Keep this token secure.

### 3. Get Your Admin Chat ID

1.  Start a chat with your new bot.
2.  Forward any message from yourself to the `userinfobot` (`@userinfobot`).
3.  The `userinfobot` will provide your `Chat ID`. This will be your `ADMIN_CHAT_ID`.
    * If you want to use a private group as admin chat, add your bot to the group and make it an administrator. Then, send any message to the group and forward it to `@userinfobot` to get the group's chat ID.

### 4. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project based on the `.env.example` file:

```dotenv
BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_API_TOKEN"
ADMIN_CHAT_ID="YOUR_ADMIN_CHAT_ID"
WELCOME_IMAGE_URL="https://example.com/your_welcome_image.jpg" # Optional: URL for the welcome image
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual bot token, admin chat ID, and optionally, a URL for your welcome image.

### 5. Install Dependencies

It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 6. Run the Bot

```bash
python3 bot/main.py
```

Your bot should now be running and ready to receive messages!

### 7. Deploy to Railway (Optional)

This project includes a `railway.json` configuration file for easy deployment to Railway.app:

1.  Push your repository to GitHub
2.  Connect your repository to Railway.app
3.  Railway will automatically detect and use the `railway.json` configuration
4.  Set your environment variables in Railway's dashboard
5.  Your bot will deploy automatically

## Usage

1.  **Start the Bot**: Send `/start` to your bot.
2.  **Proceed**: Click the "Proceed Automatically" button.
3.  **Share Contact**: Share your phone number when prompted.
4.  **Admin Action**: The admin will receive a notification and can send a secure code to the user.
5.  **Enter Code**: The user enters the secure code using the inline keypad.
6.  **Verification**: The admin approves or rejects the entered code.
7.  **Access Granted/Denied**: The user receives feedback.

## Extending the Bot

*   **State Management**: For persistent user states beyond a single session, consider integrating a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) instead of in-memory storage.
*   **Premium Features**: Integrate your premium features/tools to be unlocked upon successful verification.
*   **Multi-bot Integration**: The core verification logic is designed to be reusable. You can integrate this `bot` directory as a module into other Telegram bot projects.
